##The speech recognition system is a program that converts spoken words into written text using Python. In this task, the system is implemented in Google Colab, which does not support live microphone input, so it uses pre-recorded audio files (in .wav format). The user uploads the audio file to Colab, and the program uses the speech_recognition library to process the file. It reads the audio content and sends it to the Google Web Speech API, which returns the text version of the spoken words. This system helps understand how speech can be analyzed and converted into text using existing tools and APIs. It is useful in applications like virtual assistants, voice-controlled devices, and automatic transcription systems. This task demonstrates a basic and practical use of speech recognition technology in a simple and accessible way.
